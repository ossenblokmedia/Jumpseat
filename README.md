# Simple Jumpseat
Working simple jumpseat - this is only a way to set the pilots location this does not include the schedule booking part. I can provide that as a paid module, email me at info@ossenblok.media for information.

# Simple Jumpseat - Installation
You can drag & drop this into your installation. The only thing you need to do is execute this query in your database:
```
ALTER TABLE phpvms_pilots ADD position VARCHAR(5)
```
if you're using another prefix please dont forget to change it when executing that query

UPDATE:

You can also customise the default price modifier (0.5) by adding the line below to your "local.config.php"
```
Config::Set('JUMPSEAT_MODIFIER','0.5');
```
